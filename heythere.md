# Hello there!

Nathan here. Looks like I've finally learned my way around here! Well, for the most part anyway. Glad I could at least make this thing.

### What I've learned so far

I've learned how to change text in markdown files! I can make it *important*, make it **stand out**, and even make it [show you something cool](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3FVPDzofcvc).
I can also quote myself. Here, look-

> I can also quote myself.

See? Cool, right? Maybe not. Anyways, I also learned how to pull, clone, and commit repositories through my painful Mac setup. If it ain't broke...
I also learned how to fork and make pull requests. That's about all I've learned so far.

### What I'm confused about

I'm still not sure where all the buttons are lol. I'm going to be figuring out how to do everything efficiently for a while, but I'll get there.
I'm on the right track! Shoutout to Prof. Gentry in the Lab for helping me and relieving my sorrows.

Alright, that's all. Thanks for reading, cheers
